# What is Crux?

Crux is a component framework created over GWT for fast development of web applications.

Visit the new CruxÂ´s site and get to know more about this powerful development platform for cross-device web applications: http://www.cruxframework.org.

Crux is now maintained by	Triggo Labs	as an open source project.

## What can Crux do?
Crux allows you to create web user interfaces in a declarative and modularized way, which drastically improves development speed and code maintainability. In other words, it brings you the best of both worlds: the comfort of creating pages with HTML and the elegance of controlling those pages using Java code.

For an overview of it's features, take a look at the [Crux Showcase 5](http://showcase.cruxframework.org)


Some features provided by Crux are:

* An innovative template mechanism, which enables the reuse of HTML pages;
* A set of powerful client widgets, like data grids, wizards and tabbed pages;
* Support for cross-Module and cross-Document communication;
* Automatic binding of values between page widgets and controller's value objects;
* Declarative event handling;
* Declarative internationalization;
* Validation engine, based on Java annotations;
* Front Controller approach on client side;
* Support for data sources to widgets;
* Easy integration with other back end frameworks, like spring, guice or anything else.
* A better MVC approach, where the controllers reside on the client side of the application;
* Support for Open Social Gadgets creation;
