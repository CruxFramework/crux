Crux is an open source framework created over GWT for fast development of 
web applications.
<p>
Crux allows you to create web user interfaces in a declarative and modularized way, which drastically improves 
development speed and code maintainability. In other words, it brings you the best of both worlds: the comfort 
of creating pages with HTML and the elegance of controlling those pages using Java code.
<p>
Some features provided by Crux are:

<li>An innovative template mechanism, which enables the reuse of HTML pages;</li>
<li>A set of powerful client widgets, like data grids, wizards and tabbed pages;</li>
<li>Support for cross-module and cross-Document communication;</li>
<li>Automatic binding of values between page widgets and controller's value objects;</li>
<li>Declarative event handling;</li>
<li>Declarative internationalization;</li>
<li>Validation engine, based on Java annotations;</li>
<li>Front Controller approach on server side;</li>
<li>Support for data sources to widgets;</li>
<li>Easy integration with other back end frameworks, like spring, guice or anything else.</li>
<li>A better MVC approach, where the controllers reside on the client side of the application;</li>
<p>
